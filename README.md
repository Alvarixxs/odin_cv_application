# Odin CV Application

This repository contains the source code for the **Odin CV Application**, a project developed as part of **The Odin Project** curriculum. This application serves as an introduction to building interactive web applications using **React**.

## Project Overview

The Odin CV Application is a single-page application (SPA) that allows users to create and preview a resume or CV. This project is designed to help developers get hands-on experience with **React**, including the creation of components, managing state, and handling user inputs.

## Key Features

- **React Components:** The application is built entirely with React components, each representing different sections of the CV such as personal information, education, experience, and skills.
  
- **State Management:** State is managed at the component level to reflect changes in real-time as users input their data. This includes the use of React hooks like `useState` for functional components.

- **Form Handling:** The application includes multiple form inputs, with controlled components ensuring that user data is correctly captured and displayed.

- **Live Preview:** As users enter their information, the application dynamically updates a preview of the CV, showcasing the power of Reactâ€™s declarative nature.

- **Responsive Design:** The application is styled to be responsive, ensuring that it looks great on devices of all sizes.

## Learning Objectives

- **Introduction to React:** This project introduces the fundamental concepts of React, including component-based architecture, state management, and the use of props to pass data between components.

- **Form Handling in React:** Learn how to build and manage forms in React, including how to handle controlled components and manage form state.

- **Component Reusability:** Understand the importance of reusability in React by creating modular and maintainable components.
